# Reasons for this code

Dokuwiki is a PHP software that allows creation of wikipedia like web pages (without using any database).

The page content is formatted using its own codification (

However, at least one, markdown plugins is available (https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/edu/dokuwiki/format-doku-content/)

# Warning
Due to the fact that my mother tongue language is Italian, I set the calendar in Italian. 
Just change constants.yaml with your language, if necessary.Â
